# MNIST-DeepLearning
The MNIST handwritten digit classification problem is a standard dataset used in computer vision and deep learning.
It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.
The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.
In this journey for diving in to deep learning, we start with this problem, so we had created two deep learning model the first is a sequential model with fully connected layers(MNIST-FC), and another file that named MNIST-CONV is a API functional model that is created with convolutional layers!
